# frequently asked questions
## sptfyin, what's that? 
[sptfyin](/) is a simple spotify link shortener,
no ads, no nonsenseâ€”just short links that actually works.

## how does this work?
here's a simple example of our url shortening:

| original spotify url | shortened url |
|---------------------|---------------|
| https://open.spotify.com/artist/ | [sptfy.in/sptfy](/) |

you can then share your shortened link anywhere - social media, emails, websites, ads, affiliate links, and more!

## can i create an account?
this feature is planned and coming soon! with an account, you'll be able to:
- manage all your shortened links in one place
- view detailed analytics for each link
- customize your short urls
- edit or replace destination links

## can i replace or change the spotify link in my created short url?
right now, this isn't possible - but it's coming soon with our account feature! you'll be able to manage and edit your links once logged in.

## how can i view my link statistics?
while the full analytics dashboard is coming soon with our account feature, you can view basic stats by adding `/s` to your short url:

| your short url | stats url |
|---------------|-----------|
| [sptfy.in/raharja](https://sptfy.in/raharja) | [sptfy.in/raharja/s](https://sptfy.in/raharja/s) |

## how can i view my qr code again?
easy! just add `/s` to your short url, just like viewing statistics. your qr code will be available on that page.

## can i delete my url?
currently, as we're still working on the account feature, deletion requires verification of ownership. if you need a url deleted, please contact us through
 [our socials](/about/socials) with proof of ownership.

## will my links ever expire?
nope! your shortened links are permanent and will never expire.

## how many urls can i create?
there's no limit! create as many shortened urls as you need, but do keep in mind we have a rate limiter :)

## planned features

- **detailed analytics**: view comprehensive stats about your links *WORK IN PROGRESS*
- **subdomain choices**: you can choose your favorite subdomain like `artist.sptfy.in`, `playlist.sptfy.in`, etc

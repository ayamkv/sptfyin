sptfyin is a simple spotify link shortener,

paste your spotify track, album, or playlist url → slap on a custom back half (optional) → done. ✨

**no ads**, no nonsense—just short links that _actually_ work.

### why?

- strictly for spotify links. no weird redirects.

- want a cleaner url? add your own slug. or don’t. we’re not picky.

- self-hosted, no tracking, no bs
